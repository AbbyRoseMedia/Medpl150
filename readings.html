  <h1>Reading Reflections</h1>
  <h2>Susan Sontag's On photography</h2>
  <p> Capturing images is essential for me to retain my memories and milestones that have occurred to me over the years. In addition, using my phone I am able to quickly photograph something aesthetically pleasing to me and to document my day-to-day moments that I find interesting. When I take a picture on my phone it does not just live in my camera roll, it reflects important moments in my life that I want to look back on and share with others. While the photos I take on my cell phone hold considerable value to me, printing out a photo and having a tangible, physical copy to either put in a picture frame or simply hang on my wall in my room, makes me want to reminisce on the special moments I’ve had with the people I care about and spend so much time with. Whether it is a professional photo taken on a vacation or old family pictures, printed photos hold a lot of meaning to me because I can hold it or admire it through a picture frame and it can then take me back to that specific time or place where it was taken. I do not yet have experience with creating graphics for photos. I have, however, altered my pictures on my IPhone with basic editing to take out certain "distractions" or imperfections and things in the background that I do not want in my pictures. I have had friends of mine also use editing apps on their phones such as “PicsArt” and “Color Pop Effects Photo Editor” to add colors into my picture to make the colors vibrant and enhance saturation.  But my goal for this semester is to grasp a good foundation for creating graphics for photos as I want to one day go into advertising for brands on social media and that would be a critical and important skill to have.

  <p>Plato’s Cave from Susan Sontag’s book “On Photography” was a very insightful and comprehensive view of the use of the camera. As aforementioned, taking pictures on my phone is a way of efficiently recording my memories and my day-to-day life. According to the text it supports this by saying “But when we are nostalgic, we take pictures. It is a nostalgic time right now, and photographs actively promote nostalgia. Photography is an elegiac art, a twilight art… Precisely by slicing out this moment and freezing it, all photographs testify to time’s relentless melt.” Taking pictures helps me relive the moments that have happened. Another part of the reading that I found fascinating was when Sontag discussed how people who were “robbed of their past” are seemingly the most enthusiastic to take pictures now. According to the text it states “Everyone who lives in an industrialized society is obliged gradually to give up the past, but in certain countries, such as the United States and Japan, the break with the past has been particularly traumatic.” As you can see, Susan Sontag gave an historical approach in her writing to why photography has played such an important role in the past and continues to do so in today’s day and age.
