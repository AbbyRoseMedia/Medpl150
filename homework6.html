  <h2>Reflection</h2>
 <p>For homework #6 I wanted to create a realistic eye opposed to a cartoon inspired eye. My goal was to replicate my own eye and make it look like an eye that you would see in anatomy photos. First I clicked on create and went to shapes and clicked on the oval. Then I used the select tool to adjust the eyes and I gave it an oval shape. I then used the drawing tool to add eyelashes and I added another oval to complete the eye. The sclera for the human eye is white but for my eye I went with this dark to light blue gradient. I did this by going to the color panel and I looked at the different gradients and found a darker blue to light blue which I thought was nice because blue represents calmness and peace. The iris is a very light pink color because I wanted a soft color to contrast well with the blue surrounding it. Lastly I chose the color yellow for the pupil because yellow represents happiness. </p>
